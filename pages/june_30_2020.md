### June 30, 2020

Today is the public launch of my site and blog. It coincides with my job hunt in earnest.
Together with my family, I will almost certainly be moving to Denver, Colorado in about a year.
So I have a year to find a job that isn't soul-crushing, that can support 5 people, and is actually hiring.
I hope you find what I do interesting if you ever want to talk about it all you can find my main site at
[gielpy.github.io](gielpy.github.io).

Best,
Greg
